CHANGELOG:

20170513

INDEX.HTML: Created skeleton and ported to Bootstrap as I want this to be responsive. Added header, three containers, and a footer.

STYLE.CSS: Began styling some elements such as the footer. It's not going anywhere so I may as well get it done now.

RESET.CSS: Created, applied, and forgot about.

GAME.JS: I pruned out everything until I had the skeleton of the framework, then began adding elements which I liked (such as the hints). I will be integrating on-key inputs rather than the on-screen keyboard that the original game featured.

Corrected some errors in the original framework such as missing semi-colons and strange invalidations. Found these in repl.it when porting over to troubleshoot logic.
